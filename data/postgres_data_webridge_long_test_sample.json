Otherwise, open a cursor for Restaurant_Type rows where ResTypeID is greater than half of para_ResTypeID, setting the flag to 4. For flags 2-4, iterate over the cursor: if flag equals 2, update the current row's ResName to 'COMPLETED' if ResID is below 50, or otherwise accumulate ResID values. If flag equals 3, assign 'OVER_LIMIT', 'WITHIN_RANGE', or 'BELOW_MIN' to a temporary text based on Spent value. If flag equals 4, increase a counter for even ResTypeIDs. After cursor processing: for flag 1, delete Restaurant entries with ResID below para_ResID; for flag 2 and if the accumulated sum exceeds 100, decrease Spent by 10 for Visits_Restaurant entries where Spent is above 200; for flag 3 and if temporary text is 'OVER_LIMIT', remove Visits_Restaurant entries with Spent over 150; for flag 4 and if the counter exceeds 5, update Restaurant_Type with ResTypeName as 'PROCESSED' where ResTypeID is below para_ResTypeID. If none of these, update Restaurant to set ResName as 'DEFAULT' where ResID is null."

For `para_property_id` less than 0, compute `result_val` as the absolute value of `para_property_id` and update `Other_Property_Features` by setting `property_id` to `result_val` where `property_feature_description` matches `para_property_feature_description`. For IDs less than 10, set `result_val` to `para_property_id + 5` and delete entries from `Other_Property_Features` where `property_id` equals `para_property_id`.

For IDs less than 30, compute `result_val` as `para_property_id - 8` and delete from `Other_Available_Features` where `feature_id` equals `para_feature_id`.

Set `status_text` to 'active' and update `Other_Available_Features` by adding 12 to `feature_id` where `feature_type_code` equals `para_feature_type_code`. Update `Other_Property_Features` setting `property_id` to `result_val` where `property_feature_description` equals `para_property_feature_description`. Subtract 7 from `result_val`.

    "detailed_text": "Create a PLpgSQL stored procedure that starts by declaring a cursor 'cur' to select Attendance and integer from the performance table where Attendance exceeds a given parameter (para_Attendance). It also declares a record variable 'rec', and initializes 'var1' as twice the para_Num_of_Pieces and 'var2' as the text representation of para_Performance_ID. Depending on the value of para_Num_of_Pieces, perform different actions: if it's less than 10, update the member_attendance table by adding para_Performance_ID to Num_of_Pieces for entries where Num_of_Pieces is less than var1 and delete records from performance where Attendance equals para_Attendance and integer matches var2. For values between 10 and 19, open the cursor and iterate over each row, updating member_attendance's Performance_ID with the row's integer when Num_of_Pieces equals the row's Attendance, incrementing var1 in each iteration. For values between 20 and 29, update the integer field in performance to var2 for entries where Attendance is less than para_Attendance, append '_updated' to Performance_ID in member_attendance, and delete performance records where Attendance is divisible by 5. When the range is 30 to 39, update Num_of_Pieces in member_attendance by halving it if para_Performance_ID is over 50, or tripling it otherwise, then delete records with null integers in performance, and insert a new row with 'fallback' values. If para_Num_of_Pieces is 40 or more, insert a new row into performance with para_Attendance and para_integer, and change Performance_ID to 'final_state' in member_attendance where Num_of_Pieces is greater than 100."
